PULUTOF1 4-sensor Development Kit


Features:

* 3D Time-of-Flight distance measurement

* 4 sensors connected to the master with flat flex cables. Maximum recommended cable length 500mm.

* 160x60 distance measurement pixel per sensor
* 110x46 degree field of view per sensor
* 28 W peak optical power on 850 nm NIR
* Minimum distance 100 mm
* Maximum distance 4-5 meters typical depending on conditions

* Works in sunlight (with reduced accuracy and range in direct, strong sunlight)
* Dealiasing, interference detection & removal, "mid-lier" (flying pixel) removal, for fault-free point cloud, especially designed for mobile robot obstacle mapping
* Temperature compensation
* Offset calibration
* 3-level HDR (High Dynamic Range) imaging
* Modulated stray light estimation & compensation

* 2 frames per second per sensor (8 FPS total for 4 sensors) in standard configuration. Can be upgraded to 4-5 FPS.

* Connects to most single-board computers with SPI interface
* Specifically designed to work as a HAT (hardware attachment) for Raspberry Pi 3

* Open source (GPL2) low-level firmware allows working around application-specific requirements, formerly very difficult to deal with
* Open source (GPL2) example linux software (in C) works as the application development basis
* The software saves .xyz or .csv files out of box on the Raspberry Pi



Specifications:

Power supplies:

Input power supply: 18V to 24V, at least 1.2A
