PuluTOF1 Development Kit of Four Sensors


Features:

* Sensor Technology: Realtime 3D Time-of-Flight distance measurement

* Sensors: 4 modules 9600 pixels each, connected to a master board with flat flex cables. Maximum recommended cable length 500mm.

* Distance measurements: 160x60 pixels per sensor x 4 sensors = 28.4 kDistances / frame
* Instantaneous Field of View (FOV): 110x46 degree per sensor
* Peak optical power: 28 W 850 nm NIR
* Minimum distance 100 mm
* Maximum distance: typically 4-5 meters typical depending on external light and material reflectivity

* Strong ambient light: works in direct sunlight with reduced accuracy and range
* 3-level HDR (High Dynamic Range) imaging
* Error detection and correction in stock firmware:
  * Dealiasing
  * interference detection & removal
  * "Mid-lier" (flying pixel) removal
  * Producing fault-free point cloud, especially designed for mobile robot obstacle mapping
* Accuracy optimizations in stock firmware:
  * Temperature compensation
  * Offset calibration
  * Modulated stray light estimation & compensation

* Frame rate on stock firmware: 10 frames per second (kit), 2.5 FPS (per sensor)

* Interface: SPI. Compatible with most single-board computers.
* Raspberry Pi 3 compatibility: Yes. Specifically designed to work as a HAT (hardware attachment)
* The supplied example software saves .xyz or .csv files out of box on Raspberry Pi 3

* Licensing:
* Open Source GPL2 low-level firmware allows working around application-specific requirements, formerly very difficult to deal with.
* Open Source GPL2 linux example software (written in C) is delivered as is for development purposes
* RESTRICTIONS: Internal firmware piece of the imager chip (called "sequencer program") is Copyright Espros Photonics Corporation, licensed to be distributed to our direct customers only.
